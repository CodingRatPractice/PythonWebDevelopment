# PythonWebDevelopment
## What is this?
This repository is a log that shows my progression in python web development. The core of my knowledge within this area will be displayed throughout these files.
## Development Environment
The IDE I am using for this project is Pycharm. This is an IDE that I have yet to use which is why I am taking the oppurtunity to learn it.

To start I created a virtual environment using ```py -m venv .env``` (within a terminal) which creates a virtual environment in the folder .env.
I then activated the environment using ```.\env\Scripts\activate```
